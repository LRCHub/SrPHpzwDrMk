[00:08.50] I know that you're waiting for this tonight
[00:16.48] I can't wait till the sun turns to light
[00:23.20] Fireflies
[00:24.70] They color my eyes
[00:27.20] Feel a void without the fire, ignite it
[00:31.21] Butterflies
[00:32.67] Come, promised to me
[00:35.26] That you'll shine along the way
[00:39.46] Just shoot from my heart, shoot from the—
[00:43.32] Salute from the heart
[00:47.46] Just shoot from my heart, shoot from the—
[00:51.35] Salute from the heart
[00:55.45] Just shoot from my heart, shoot from the—
[00:59.34] Salute from the heart
[01:03.45] Just shoot from my heart, shoot from the—
[01:07.35] Salute from the heart
[01:12.47] I know that you're waiting for this tonight
[01:20.45] I can't wait till the sun turns to light
[01:27.97] I can't help myself when it's you and I
[01:33.53] Ooh, mhm
[01:35.78] But I've been hurt before
[01:38.19] I know how to hold on
[01:42.72] I've traveled the world
[01:44.48] But my room is perfect
[01:46.97] Love is within
[01:48.50] Are we still searching?
[01:50.99] Can we let go of the world so judging?
[01:54.96] Don't say goodbye, there's a new beginning
[01:59.45] Just shoot from my heart, shoot from the—
[02:03.40] Salute from the heart
[02:07.45] Just shoot from my heart, shoot from the—
[02:11.37] Salute from the heart
[02:15.47] Just shoot from my heart, shoot from the—
[02:19.43] Salute from the heart
[02:23.43] Just shoot from my heart, shoot from the— (I know that you're waiting for this tonight)
[02:27.34] Salute from the heart
[02:31.62] Shoot from my heart, shoot from the— (I can't wait till the sun turns to light)
[02:35.40] Salute from the heart
[02:39.61] Shoot from my heart, shoot from the— (I can't wait till the sun turns to light)
[02:43.44] Salute from the heart (I know that you're waiting for—)
