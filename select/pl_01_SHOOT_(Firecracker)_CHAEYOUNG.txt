I know that you're waiting for this tonight
I can't wait til the sun turns to light
Fireflies
They color my eyes
Feel a void without the fire
Ignite it
Butterflies
Come, promised to me
that you'll shine along the way
Just shoot from my heart
Shoot from the
Salute from the heart
Just shoot from my heart
Shoot from the
Salute from the heart
Just shoot from my heart
Shoot from the
Salute from the heart
Just shoot from my heart
Shoot from the

I know that you're waiting for this tonight
I can't wait til the sun turns to light
I can't help myself when it's you and I
Ohhh mmm
But I've been hurt before
I know how to hold on
I've traveled the world

Love is within why are we still searching
Can we let go of the world so judging
Don't say goodbye theres a new beginning
Just shoot from my heart
Shoot from the
Salute from the heart
Just shoot from my heart
Shoot from the
Salute from the heart
Just shoot from my heart
Shoot from the
Salute from the heart
Just shoot from my heart (I know that you're
waiting for this tonight)
Shoot from the

Shoot from my heart (I can't wait til the sun
turns to light)
Shoot from the

Shoot from my heart (I 've been waiting for this
tonight)
